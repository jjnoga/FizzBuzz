## FizzBuzz

### What is this project?
This program iterates through integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive). Each integer will be prompted by conditional statements to see if they are divisible by 3 or 5. If the number being examined is divisible by 3, the program prints "Fizz," and if it's divisible by 5, the program prints "Buzz." However, if the integer is divisible by both 3 and 5, the program instead outputs "FizzBuzz." If the integer is not divisible by 3 or 5, the program simply prints out the integer.
